The map above provides a general overview of the country’s provinces, along with a more specified view of two: the provinces of Guanacaste and Limón. (Due to the influence of tourism in both of these areas, I was hoping to focus on these provinces for later analysis. However, due to their high population numbers, I had to select different areas for subsequent analysis.)
